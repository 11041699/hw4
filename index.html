        <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple.com - Contrast</a>
        (<a href="#navigation">Nav</a>)
    </h2>
    <p>
        I think that Apple.com is a great example of Contrast and Similarity because it uses <br> them to
        emphesize viewers' attention to the product but also clearly show information <br> about details and prices
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Apple uses different shades of grey to separate parts of the websites: <br> Navigation, Unicef anouncemnet, product info.
        </li>
        <p>
            <img src="images/img1.png" alt="Contrast Example 1" width="500">
        </p>
        <li>Apple's product photos are much brighter than other elements of the website  <br> and this drags viewers' attention.</li>
        <p>
        <img src="images/img2.png" alt="Contrast Example 2" width="500">
        </p>
        <li>Apple uses font contrast to present the Product's Name, its new slogan, <br> additional info about release date, and links for more info.</li>
        <p>
        <img src="images/img3.png" alt="Contrast Example 3"  width="500">

        <a href="https://1inch.io">1inch.io - Repetition</a>
        (<a href="#navigation">Nav</a>)
    </h2>
    <p>
        I think that 1inch.io uses repetition, patterns, and rhythm to create a very nice website
    </p>

    <ol>
        <li>
            All of the colors on the page are neon and glowing.
        </li>
        <p>
            <img src="images/img4.png" alt="Repetition Example 1.1" width="500">
            <img src="images/img5.png" alt="Repetition Example 1.2" width="500">
        </p>
        <li>
            All of the links to the detailed pages about products or feaures follow <br> the similarly styled boxes.
        </li>
        <p>
        <img src="images/img6.png" alt="Repetition Example 2" width="500">
        </p>
        <li>There is a rhythm on the page from the way it switches the order of images <br> while scrolling.</li>
        <p>
        <img src="images/img7.png" alt="Repetition Example 3"  width="500">
        </p>
        <li>There is a rhythm on the page by the way it changes alignment from <br> 2 columns to 1 column.</li>
        <p>

    <h2 id="allignment">
        <a href="https://open.spotify.com">open.spotify.com - Allignment</a>
        (<a href="#navigation">Nav</a>)

    <p>
        I think that spotify uses clear alignment on its webpage.

        <dt>Separating areas</dt>
        <dd>Allignment is used to separate sidebar, navigation, and content region.</dd>
        <p>

        </p>
        <dt>Structure of playlist topics</dt>
        <dd>There are at most 5 playlists that can be fit on the page and this adds<br> a structre to playlists from different topics.</dd>
        <p>
            <img src="images/img10.png" alt="Allignment Example 1" width="500">
        </p>
        <dt>Song allignment</dt>
        <dd>It is simple to navigate through the songs within a playlist. <br>List of songs is structured as a table.</dd>

    <h2 id="proximity">
        <a href="https://www.nytimes.com">The NY Times - Proximity</a>
        (<a href="#navigation">Nav</a>)
    </h2>
    <p>
        I think that newspapers need to work with proximity very well <br> because they need to fit a lot of information on a page
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            They use a lot of white space to separate sections.
        </li>
        <p>
            <img src="images/img12.png" alt="Proximity Example 1" width="500">
        </p>
        <li>At the top they have the most basic important info such as navigation, today's date(on the left), <br> live events(in the middle), weather and stock market on the right.</li>
        <p>
        <img src="images/img13.png" alt="Proximity Example 2" width="700">
        </p>
        <li>Main topic of the day is on the fold in the center and news are surrounding the main picture.</li>

        <img src="images/img14.png" alt="Proximity Example 3"  width="500">
        </p>
        <li>There is a separate section "Opinion" on the right side of the page where <br> journalist's articles are posted, separate from the news section.</li>
